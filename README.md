# Appliance-Energy-Consumption-Prediction



## Overview
This repository contains code and documentation for predicting household appliance energy consumption
using time-series sensors and weather data. The project includes data preprocessing, exploratory
analysis, baseline tree-based models, and an LSTM deep learning model.

Running the Notebook

Locally:
jupyter notebook Energy_Prediction_LSTM.ipynb
In Google Colab:
Upload Energy_Prediction_LSTM.ipynb to Colab or use the GitHub integration.
Run cells sequentially;the notebook


##Outputs
Trained LSTM model and extra trees baseline metrics appear in output cells.
Visualizations (loss curves, feature importances, predictions) are embedded in the notebook.
Final report PDF is under reports/report.pdf.
